        <p class="p-blogcontents" align="center"> Shell (Or Bash) scripting is a form of scripting used on the linux operating system inside of the terminal. In Shell script, you can do basically anything you would do inside of the terminal, such as running commands. Created in 1989 by Brian Fox and has revolutionized the lives of many linux users such as myself.  </p>

        <p class="p-blogcontents" align="center"> The primary purpose of shell script inside of the terminal is to automate certain tasks. For example if you had to run a certain command 50 times, you could have a Shell script do it for in less than a second. Additionally like python, Shell can be used to make simple text based games. While shell isn't exactly the most capable programming language, you can still do a lot of things with it.</p>

        <p class="p-blogcontents" align="center"> Learning how to code in Shell is acctually really simple. There are no complex functions to know so you can learn Shell in practically a day. If you are going to be learning Shell, I made a github repository just for you called <a href="https://github.com/thebtlgfish/SimpleBash" target="_blank"> Simple Bash </a></p>
