    <p class="p-about" align="center"> This is the CyberFish Discord Bot. a bot that i made because i was bored and wanted to spice up my discord server (which you should join). It is very simple and is easy to waste your time. here are the key features to it. </p>
    <br> <br>
    <p class="p-about" align="center"> - A Spam Detection System </p>
    <p class="p-about" align="center"> - Command Log (Used For Analytics) </p>
    <br>
    <p class="p-about" align=""center> Just a side note, The Command Log only logs the input. The benefit of this is so that the developers can see what people are trying to input and use that data to create new features. </p>
