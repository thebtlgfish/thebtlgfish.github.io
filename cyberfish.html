    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Recently inspite of some innapropriate behavior on my friends discord Server (and because i was bored) i made a simple discord bot for my server, "The Bootleg Fishes Basement" (which you should join by the way). Its a pretty simple bot written in python with discord.py in like 3 hours. It has some basic features like spam detection, analytics, random commands, commands to question your sanity and some other pretty useless stuff. I am pretty proud of it and if you want to see its spaghetti code, check out its github <a href="https://github.com/thebtlgfish/cyberfish_discord_bot" class="link" target="_blank"> HERE </a>. </p>
    <br> <br> <br> <br>
    <h1 align="center" class="h1-bt"> FEATURES </h1>
    <br> <br>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Some key features of the bot are:</p>
    <br> <br>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Spam Detection </p>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Analytics </p>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Webhook Management </p>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> Administrator / Moderator Powers </p>
    <br>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> I am most proud of those features :] </p>
    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
    <h1 align="center" class="h1-bt"> DISCLAIMER </h1>
    <br> <br> <br>
    <p align="center" class="p-about"> I think i might have to clarify about the analytics feature, more specifically how it works and what it is used for. How it works is quite simple, every time a user sends a bot command in chat, it saves that command in a txt file on my system (where the bot is running). this way i can tell what commands are being used most often and if people are using commands that do not exist frequently, i know i should add them. What i am trying to tell you is to <b> NEVER SHARE SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO THE BOT EVER </b> as it is archived.  </p>
